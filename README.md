Peace be upon you!
How are you all doing? I hope everything’s good 💜

To be a true front-end developer, you must know how to deal with APIs — so today’s assignment is all about practicing with APIs 🤷🏻‍♂

Requirements:
🔴 Build this website with the same design (or better).
(It’s a weather website that shows the forecast for 3 days. There’s an input where the user can type the name of any city, and the data in the cards will update to show that city’s weather.)

DEMO: https://bit.ly/3S145pj

Some hints to help you ✨
1️⃣ To convert the date returned from the API into a day name (like Sunday), search about the Date Object.
2️⃣ You can also search about the Geolocation API to detect the user’s location automatically.

Important questions 🤓
❓Which API will we use?
✅ Here’s the API link and a short video to help you learn how to use it:
